After talking to one of my former fellow workers, we realized that 6 out of 10 people they fired were over 55—while a large proportion of the younger sales staff---who are paid less—kept their jobs. Assume the company has over 200 employees and that 24% of all sales people in the last census were 55 years or older. How can I find out if I have an age discrimination case and where can I turn for help?"
